# ejson

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/primus/EJSON.png)](https://travis-ci.org/primus/EJSON)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/e-json.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/e-json)

`ejson` is an extension of JSON to support more types. It supports all JSON-safe
types as well as

- **Date**: It maintains a date instance instead of transforming it to a string.
- **Binary**: `Uinit8Array`
- **User defined types**

The `ejson` module is port of Meteor's EJSON parser which has been made
compatible for Node.js and browsers. This way, other 
[real-time libraries](https://github.com/primus/primus) can also make use of
these extensions. 

## Installation

The module is released through npm:

```js
npm install --save ejson
```

## Usage

The API is exactly the same as the API that Meteor provides as it uses exactly
the same code. The most important API's are:

- `EJSON.clone`
- `EJSON.parse`
- `EJSON.stringify`

And some utility methods:

- `EJSON.toJSONValue`
- `EJSON.fromJSONValue`
- `EJSON.isBinary`
- `EJSON.newBinary`
- `EJSON.equals`

See the [meteor EJSON documentation](http://docs.meteor.com/#ejson) for more
detailed information.
